# First Personal Portfolio – Version 1.0 (Front-End Only)

This repository contains the very first portfolio website I ever created.  
It was developed in one week as part of a study project and represents my second website ever, and my first solo project without team collaboration.

Because of that, this version means a lot to me. It captures the moment where I first applied everything I knew at the time: basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, simple layout structure, and early UI decisions. Looking back at it now helps me see how much I’ve evolved as a developer.

## About This Version

This first portfolio showcases:

- My introduction as an aspiring developer  
- A basic skills section  
- Early featured projects  
- A simple layout designed in Figma  
- A fully static structure with no backend or dynamic functionality  

This version remains exactly as it was when completed.  
It serves as a historical snapshot of my starting point and the foundation for everything I built afterward.

## Evolution of the Project

This portfolio marks the beginning of my journey as a developer.  
From here, the project evolved in several stages:

### Version 1.0 — This Repository  
My first personal portfolio, built in one week, fully static and created during my early studies.

### Version 2.0 — Lorkut (Static Prototype)  
A more advanced project inspired by Orkut, created later in my learning path.  
This version includes modern layout structure, interactive elements in JavaScript, and a complete visual prototype designed in Figma.

### Version 3.0 — Lorkut (Dynamic Version)  
A complete rewrite with backend technologies:  
PHP, MySQL, modular architecture, partials, a real database, a visit counter, and functional server deployment.

## Note

This repository intentionally preserves the original version without modifications, as part of my learning timeline and personal growth as a developer.
