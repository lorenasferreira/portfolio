# Portfolio Project – Lorkut (Version 1.0 – Front-End Only)

This repository presents the front-end version of my personal portfolio project, inspired by the nostalgic Orkut style. It showcases my evolution as a developer and reflects my visual identity, design decisions, and technical growth throughout my learning journey.

This **Version 1.0** contains only the **static implementation** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The fully functional **Version 2.0**, which includes PHP, MySQL, dynamic features, partials, and a real backend environment, is deployed separately.

**Live Version 2.0 (full dynamic version):**

## About the Project

This portfolio is designed to visually represent my work, skills, and development process.  
It includes sections for:

- Personal introduction  
- Technical skills  
- Featured projects  
- Contact information  

The design aims for a consistent visual identity and smooth navigation across devices.

This repository preserves the **initial static phase** of the project and serves as a historical record of how the project started before implementing backend functionality.
